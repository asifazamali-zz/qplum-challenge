There are  N cars placed along a (road) positive X-axis (say at co-ordinates x<sub>1</sub>=1, x<sub>2</sub>=5, x<sub>3</sub>=3 etc.)

Each car has a certain constant velocity (say v<sub>1</sub>=6, v<sub>2</sub>=3, v<sub>3</sub>=1 etc.).

If we just start this system at t=0, and keep it running till t=oo, what will be the total number of overtakes that will occur?


Input Format:

N # Number of test cases

P<sub>1</sub> # Number of cars in the test case.

X<sub>1</sub> V<sub>1</sub> # Starting position of first car and velocity.

X<sub>2</sub> V<sub>2</sub> # Starting position of second car and velocity.

.

.

X<sub>P1</sub> V<sub>P1</sub> # Starting position of car P1 and velocity.
